      "Relentless -- You are a <strong>Relentless Primitive (RP)</strong>. Beyond trying hard, never giving up, or having grit, RP’s have a radical way of charging forward with their careers. This colors everything that you do, from how you approach rewards to how you bounce back from failures. But just as much as you know how to barrel full steam ahead, you also know when to pump the brakes and abruptly change direction. In the traditional sense, relentless means being oppressively constant, but context matters! An RP does not shy away from self-preservation. To be relentless is to focus on yourself and your goals; everything becomes secondary. An RP is always looking forward, although that doesn’t mean you don’t occasionally glance backward at the zigzagging road you traveled. RP’s immediately recognize what requires their attention, and they have no problem dropping less important things at a moment’s notice. RP’s never lose sight of their mission and don’t allow less important problems to obscure it. RP’s are known to often make selfish, but necessary decisions.",

You know when to charge full steam ahead and when to slow down, when to cut corners and when to be a perfectionist. You are not afraid to take calculated risks when they can help you achieve your goals. You don’t necessarily follow the rules when they don’t make sense to do so. You don’t always wait in line like everyone else, even if you aren’t necessarily qualified for what you are attempting to do. You don’t wait your turn in pushing to achieve your goals. You go get what you want; you grab your spear and go hunting. This does not mean just “trying hard.” You realize that sometimes telling white lies is a part of doing business.",

      mediumRP:

You are willing to cut corners or tell white lies when appropriate, but you are not necessarily against doing things by the book. When particularly motivated you will work hard to get what you want, but you may not be willing to think out of the box to get there. Sometimes you can be traditional, but you are open to trying new things and hearing new ideas.",

        "<strong>Low RP -</strong> As a low RP, you are more prone to implementing a strict no-nonsense style that stresses self-motivation, sweat, and a perpetually positive attitude that never wavers, even when hard work yields little or no results. You naturally work hard and try hard, believe you can succeed, and get up and try again. This is worthwhile in pursuits like algebra, practicing piano, or various specialized tasks. Your working style is more on the traditional side of things. You find comfort in dropping your line in the water, sitting back, and waiting for a fish to bite. Work may always be about the long run rather than short bursts. You are structured, wedded to procedures, and like to feel that everything you do is part of an ongoing and orderly track that leads you very clearly from point A to point B. You are a marathon runner, not a sprinter. You may be more prone to “people please” and put the priorities of others before your own. You dislike wasting time at all.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #1: Practice the <strong>“five-to-one”</strong> rule: for every five unavoidable meetings in conference rooms with agendas and PowerPoint presentations, have one work playdate. Not necessarily drunken karaoke or catching a silly movie with a colleague, but getting together with someone or a team of people you like--friend, vendor, partner, boss, employee--and bounding ideas around in an environment that isn’t the office and doesn’t feel restrictive.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #2: Make a habit of scheduling regular meetups with friends and colleagues--whether it’s coffee, lunch, after-work drinks, or ski trips. It might sound trivial, but that old-fashioned social interaction can be as important to your overall health as hitting the gym. Play in real life. Playing around with people you enjoy connecting with is an excellent way to work that childlike muscle and escape whatever professional rut you may be stuck in.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #3: Rather than being quick to forgive slights and forget failures, find a physical object that reminds you of a past setback and look at it once a week. Reflect on your hardships, remember that your difficult beginnings, and use them to fuel your progression.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #4: Think like a door-to-door salesperson, not a Wall Street Banker. Focus on the quality and variety of the conversations with key stakeholders that will keep them coming back, not just the quality of your bottom line. Take your work personally.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #5: For those still choosing a career path, find something you are natural at and then milk it as much as humanly possible. Relentless primitives often do not have the patience to learn a new skill from scratch; they find something they are good at and then search for a way to monetize it. Try the same! When you focus on what you are good at, work inherently becomes more personal. You become valued for a skill you possess, and you can make more money doing that.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #6: Don’t be afraid or resistant to changing lanes. Don’t get too attached to your first moves. Be willing to change lanes comfortably and nimbly.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #7: Hitting pause on your current career trajectory does not just mean taking a breather during lunch. It can also mean stopping to reassess the weeks, months, and years ahead. Take frequent breaks to reexamine your situation. Never stop reassessing.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #8: Begin each day by laying out precisely what you want to accomplish. Only then do you open your inbox and determine what can wait a day, a week, or a month. Focus solely on what can help you meet your big goals for the day, even if you piss some people off in the process.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #9: Let your brain roam occasionally without purpose, and wander off without being taxed by conventional tasks. Give yourself the freedom to make all sorts of new discoveries about you and your work. If circumstances allow it, give yourself short breaks during the workday dedicated to nothing but recharging. If possible, take a thirty-minute walk, bike around the park, take a midday yoga class, or catch a matinee. Find regular downtime during your day you can take advantage of.",

      "Primal Tip for RP’s #10: Go on “playdates” with friends/colleagues/employees that leave you charged up, excited, and ready to take on the world. Grown-ups have meetings that leave you drained, rarely seeming to accomplish anything. A relentless company nurtures independent thinking, where pitching new ideas and rethinking age-old techniques is not only tolerated but encouraged.",

You do believe in being optimistic and cheerful around others, and can be known as a “Team player.” You crave psychological safety, i.e. the safety to take risks and make mistakes, and being insulated from criticism for making mistakes among peers, friends, and colleagues.

Realize that asking questions is not a sign of weakness but healthy curiosity and interest in getting to the bottom of things. Learn to get better at asking questions. Those who never ask questions and dutifully follow orders often fare worse in the long run.",

      "Primal Tip for OP’s #4: Ask nontrivial questions, those that demonstrate intelligence, a drive to learn, and curiosity. But be careful not to sound accusatory. Be respectful and focused on the answer while being oppositional.",

      "Primal Tip for OP’s #5: Wrestle with constraints, do not try to escape them. Use them as building blocks. Physical vulnerability and psychological unease are often traits of success. Being forced to navigate a unique set of circumstances can make you likely to reach pinnacles in your field.",

      "Primal Tip for OP’s #6: Instead of, or at least, in addition to, cursing the constraints foisted upon you, try to draw some inspiration from them. By seeing barriers as opportunities, you might be more inclined to develop imaginative ideas.",

True Oppositional Primitives are often the fastest to praise, just as they are the fastest to criticize. Learn to deliver praise as sincerely as you deliver rebuke. Be able to let go of ego and accept a good idea no matter its source.",
