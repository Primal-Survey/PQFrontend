Beyond trying hard, never giving up, or having grit, RP’s have a radical way of charging forward with their careers. This colors everything that you do, from how you approach rewards to how you bounce back from failures. But just as much as you know how to barrel full steam ahead, you also know when to pump the brakes and abruptly change direction. To be relentless is to focus on yourself and your goals; everything becomes secondary. An RP always looks forward, although that doesn’t mean you don’t occasionally glance backward at the zigzagging road you traveled. RP’s excel at recognizing what requires their attention, and they have no problem dropping less important things at a moment’s notice. RP’s never lose sight of their mission and don’t allow less important problems to obscure it. RP’s are known to often make selfish, but necessary decisions.",
